# INDUS – Project Report

## 🪴 Executive Summary
INDUS is a dual-mode employment and identity platform designed to connect India’s daily wage labor force with trusted employers across rural and semi-urban sectors. It empowers workers by offering two access pathways: a voice-first IVR system for low-literate users, and a fully functional mobile app in local languages for digitally comfortable users.

> The true solution to rural unemployment lies not in superficial tech layers but in digging deep into the roots of rural India — its habits, challenges, languages, and systems of trust. INDUS is built with that philosophy at its core.

## 🧩 The Core Problem
- 90%+ of India’s workforce is informal and unstructured.
- Daily wage workers rely on verbal networks or physical labor spots.
- Employers face delays in hiring reliable labor.
- Workers lack verified professional identity, reducing bargaining power.
- Technology is inaccessible to low-literate or non-smartphone users.

## 🌐 The Unified Platform Approach
### GrameenLink – Rural LinkedIn
- Voice and text-based profile creation
- Local language app with:
  - Skill tags (construction, agriculture, etc.)
  - Ratings from verified employers
  - Voice resume upload
  - Digital identity through Aadhaar or SHG linkage

### Shram Saathi – Dynamic Job Matching
- Job posting by SMEs, contractors, farmers
- Real-time matching via:
  - Skill filters
  - Location and availability
  - Employer priority
- Two-way communication:
  - IVR + SMS (for voice users)
  - Mobile notifications and app messages

### ShaktiScore – Work History–Backed Credit Score (Upcoming Feature)
- Uses worker’s job log, frequency, employer ratings, and repeat work data
- Generates a creditworthiness score (ShaktiScore) from 0 to 100
- Unlocks access to:
  - Microloans from partnered NBFCs or cooperatives
  - Prepaid tools or kits (safety gear, phones)
  - Emergency credit for seasonal workers

## 👤 Ashok’s Journey – A Multi-Platform Experience
Ashok begins with IVR registration. His voice resume is recorded. After successful matches, he installs the app at a kiosk support camp. Now, he applies for jobs using the mobile app, listens to voice alerts, and checks payment history — all in Bhojpuri. Over time, his ShaktiScore improves, enabling him to apply for a ₹5000 seasonal microloan for farm tools.
