# SINDH Application - "Accept Job" Button Issue Fix

## Issue Summary
The "Accept Job" button was not appearing on the Available Jobs page even when a worker was logged in, likely due to the `user` object from `UserContext` not having the correct type or not being properly recognized.

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Login Handling**
   - Updated the login process to ensure proper user data structure is saved
   - Added a separate `userType` storage in localStorage as a backup
   - Improved user object validation with type validation

2. **User Context Improvements**
   - Made `loadBasicUserFromStorage` more robust to handle missing user type
   - Enhanced `fetchUserProfile` to validate user object before setting state
   - Updated `logoutUser` to clear all user-related data from localStorage

3. **Auth Utilities**
   - Created utility functions (`authUtils.js`) for consistent auth state checking:
     - `isAuthenticated()` - Check if user is logged in
     - `getUserType()` - Get user type from multiple sources
     - `getCurrentUser()` - Get user data with validation
     - `isWorker()` - Check if current user is a worker
     - `isEmployer()` - Check if current user is an employer

4. **AvailableJobs Component Updates**
   - Updated "Accept Job" button visibility check to use multiple sources:
     - Primary: `user.type === 'worker'`
     - Fallback: `isWorker()` utility function
   - Modified `handleAcceptJob` to work even if context is not fully populated
   - Added debugging information to help diagnose issues

5. **Debug Tools**
   - Created `AuthDebugger` component for real-time auth state visualization
   - Added useful console logs to trace user state throughout the app

## How to Verify the Fix
1. Login as a worker (using phone number and OTP '0000')
2. Navigate to Available Jobs page
3. The "Accept Job" button should now be visible
4. Accepting a job should work properly

If there are still issues:
1. Check the browser console for any errors
2. Look at the AuthDebugger component on the Available Jobs page
3. Verify that localStorage has proper user data with correct "type" field

## Next Steps
1. Remove debug code before production deployment
2. Consider implementing more robust state management
3. Add more detailed error logging
